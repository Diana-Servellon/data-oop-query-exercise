# data-oop-query-exercise

## Exercise 1 
On exercise 1, I made the entity-relationship model. Thus, the relational schema model was easier to implement. I also used MySQL Workbench to model the data.
- 3 hours in both models

## Exercise 2 
On exercise 2, I develop the Business Model of the data modeled. I also use inheritance, SOLID principles (as the use of interfaces, abstraction and let code open to grow). Finally, I added test cases for some actions in vehicle and discounts methods. It was implemented on C#.
- 2 hours on the project

## Exercise 3
On this exercise, I develop a query in which I explored the data with pandas and then searched for the most sale cars.
- 2 hours learning the basics of pandas
- 1.5 hours implementing the exercise
