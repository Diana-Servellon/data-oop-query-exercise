# data-oop-query-exercise

##Exercise 1 - 3 hours in both models
On exercise 1, I made the entity-relationship model. Thus, the relational schema model was easier to implement. I also used MySQL Workbench to model the data.

##Exercise 2 - 2 hours
On exercise 2, I develop the Business Model of the data modeled. I also use inheritance, SOLID principles (as the use of interfaces, abstraction and let code open to grow). Finally, I added test cases for some actions in vehicle and discounts methods. It was implemented on C#.

##Exercise 3
On this exercise, I develop a query in which I explored the data with pandas and then searched for the most sale cars.
- 2 hours lerning pandas
- 1.5 hours implementing the exercise
